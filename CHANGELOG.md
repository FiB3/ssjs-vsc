# Change Log

All notable changes to the "ssjs-vsc" extension will be documented here:

## [0.7.0] - 2025-04-13

### Added:
- __Live Preview__: this handy feature allows you to test frontend directly on your laptop, without upload to SFMC - Templating included. Handy for pages that use APIs to access SFMC functionality.
- Commands: `Live Preview Start`, `Stop` & `Get Live Preview URL`.
- New templating column for Live Preview.
- Automatic reload for Live Preview (on file save), with option in Preferences to enable this feature.
- New Status Bar (right bottom corner) that shows when Live Preview is active (SSJS: <PORT>). Default is still port 4000. You can change this in `.vscode/ssjs-config.json`
- `Copy Templated Code` command. It fills the Mustached content with your tags (of your env) and copies content to clipboard.
- `Refresh Config` button in Config panel.
- Automate version in your scripts by simply using `{{VERSION}}`` mustache tag. Date time is used, as biggest use for version in SFMC is to know the time of last deployment.

### Changed:
- Visual Improvements to Templating panel.
- Latest Changes (in Config panel) are now showing `Changelog`.
- Internal refactors, some unit tests.

### Fixed:
- Several bugs fixed.

### Removed:
- Poor Server Provider. But who used it anyway?
- `Start` and `Stop` commands.
- Create config commands: Create Config, Update Config, Deploy Any Path. _Config_ Panel is the way to go.

## [0.6.9] - 2025-03-19

### Added:
- Api counter shows since when it's being counted (on hover).
- New "Log" type for text preview, which automatically detects format used in Email360 SSJS Lib - let me know, if you want other formats.
- Workspace trust support.

### Fixed:
- Improved HttpRequest snippet.
- Text preview resizing and styling improvements.
- Formatting: mustache syntax will no longer get broken.
- Other smaller bugs.

## [0.6.9] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed:

## [0.6.8] - 2025-01-26

### Added:
- New `Upload Script to Dev` icon (cloud) for supported files (top right corner of editor tab) - next to `Run` icon.
- New `SSJS: Check Dev Pages` command to test configuration of your Development Cloud Page and Text Resource.
- New button with the _Check Dev Pages_ functionality replaced a checkbox in the Config's _Deploy Cloud Page & Text Resource_ section.
- New _Test Configuration_ button in the Config panel, that validates your connection to SFMC (available only when configuration appears valid). Great when you have e.g. changed the Business unit.
- Support for additional file types via new Preference: `Editor: Additional File Types`. Now you can test other files you are working on (like SSJS libraries in .js files).

### Changed:
- `Develop` section in the Config panel is no longer mandatory.
- Config's _Folder in Content Builder_ shows configured folder.
- When asset is not found in SFMC a more precise notification is shown.
- Offer script's metadata deletetion, when asset is not found in SFMC.
- Dev Pages return 3 new headers that allow for testing the Dev Pages.

## [0.6.1] - 2024-09-29

### Added:
- On-save hooks that allow running terminal/command line commands before saving scripts to SFMC.  
This allows combining __SSJS Manager__ with tools like __generator-ssjs__.  
Now you can use other file types (like `.js`) and build those into `.ssjs`, `.amp` or `.html`.  
This feature also supports preview of code as before.  
Output of build command is shown in the debug console.
- On-save hooks supported by getting path and preview (except for the run-icon).
