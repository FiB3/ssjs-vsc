The `v0.1.2` and `v0.1.2` are out!

Recently, I have added new features:

Automatic deploy in Asset Provider: first deploy needs to always be done manually. This is in order so you can select which scripts you want to automatically deploy.

Initial walkthrough for setup - this will appear automatically after the installation. Or by running the `SSJS: Show Setup Walkthrough` command.

Tweaking the documentation bit further.
